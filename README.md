# pillows_xpress
Application project for Hack Reactor Remote. The elements of this project include:

1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JavaScript
	- Higher order functions
	- Use of only native methods (note that I have used Template Strings available only in ECMAScript-6 to write the code in the finder.js file. I found that Template Strings are only supported in Chrome and Safari in El Capitan and so I used Babel to make the file compatible with browsers that do not support Template Strings.
	- Commenting. I tried to write the functions and variables in a way that limited the need for detailed commenting.  But in places where I thought it was needed for additional clarification, I included comments

I hope you enjoy checking out the application - the GitHub repository can be found at https://github.com/brentcolson/pillows_xpress and the website is being hosted at brentcolson.com
